{"product_name": "Startup Evolve Grey", "price": 99.0, "desc": "Following Atom's groundbreaking idea, we have created a new icon with Startup, resetting the concept of the sneaker-shoe hybrid with a more sporty model without losing the shoe's elegance. It has a double density die-cut EVA sole, thus gaining in lightness and durability.\n\nIn addition, we have also re-designed, thanks to your feecback, the Startup surface with an ultra-breathable and more elastic knit fabric, so that your foot fits perfectly. The rest you can see for yourself, a groundbreaking design, with a \"Slip-On\" closure in which to tie or not the laces depends only on you.", "product_img": "1327-large_default.jpg", "product_subimg1": "1328-large_default.jpg", "product_subimg2": "1329-large_default.jpg", "product_subimg3": "1330-large_default.jpg", "category": "sneakers"}
